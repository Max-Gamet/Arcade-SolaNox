This is a one-stop website for fun. Developed my Max-Gamet.

Various games are listed below -
Tic - Tac - Toe
Snake
Rock Paper Scissors
Memory Game

And there is a game, Chess, which is currently underdeveloped, and I plan to develop it in the near future.

Nevermind the Login and sign-up buttons don't work, they are just for aesthectics and my main purpose was to make it work offline, and it stores data in local storage.
You can play those games for fun.
Thank You for supporting.
